### ▶ Smart Contract
➡️ a smart contract is a **self-executing program**  
➡️ written using **Solidity** (most commonly on Ethereum)  

➡️ contains predefined **rules and conditions**
➡️ once deployed to the blockchain:
   - code cannot be changed
   - no one can bypass or override its logic  

➡️ written by a developer  
➡️ stored permanently on the blockchain  

➡️ when conditions defined in the contract are met:
   - the contract **automatically executes**
   - execution does not require a middleman  

➡️ ensures:
   - trustless execution
   - transparency
   - immutability  
➡️ “code is law” principle applies here
```

```markdown
### ▶ How Smart Contracts Work
➡️ developer writes contract logic in Solidity  

➡️ contract is compiled into bytecode  
➡️ bytecode is deployed to the blockchain  

➡️ once deployed:
   - contract gets a unique blockchain address  
   - lives on multiple nodes  

➡️ users or other contracts interact with it by:
   - sending transactions
   - calling contract functions  

➡️ blockchain validates:
   - transaction authenticity
   - input conditions  

➡️ if conditions are satisfied:
   - contract executes exactly as written  
➡️ if not:
   - transaction fails and state is unchanged  

➡️ every execution:
   - is verified by the network
   - consumes gas
```

```markdown
### ▶ Ethereum Blockchain
➡️ Ethereum is a **decentralized blockchain platform**  

➡️ main purpose:
   - deploy and run smart contracts  

➡️ unlike Bitcoin:
   - Ethereum is programmable  
   - supports complex application logic  

➡️ provides infrastructure for:
   - decentralized applications (dApps)
   - DeFi
   - NFTs
   - DAOs  

➡️ Ethereum acts as:
   - the global execution layer
   - the settlement layer for smart contracts
```

```markdown
### ▶ EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
➡️ EVM = Ethereum Virtual Machine  

➡️ a **runtime environment** for smart contracts  
➡️ works like a sandboxed container  

➡️ responsibilities:
   - executes smart contract bytecode  
   - ensures deterministic execution  
   - isolates contract execution from host machine  

➡️ runs on every Ethereum node  
➡️ guarantees:
   - same input → same output on all nodes  

➡️ prevents:
   - malicious code behavior
   - system-level access  

➡️ makes Ethereum truly decentralized and trustless
```

```markdown
### ▶ Gas
➡️ gas is the **smallest unit of computational cost**  

➡️ every operation in EVM has a gas cost  
➡️ more complex logic = more gas  

➡️ gas is used to:
   - prevent infinite loops
   - protect the network from spam  

➡️ user pays gas for:
   - deploying contracts
   - executing contract functions  

➡️ if gas runs out:
   - transaction fails
   - state changes are reverted
```

```markdown
### ▶ Ether (ETH)
➡️ Ether is the **native currency of Ethereum**  

➡️ used to:
   - pay gas fees
   - reward validators/miners  

➡️ acts as:
   - digital money
   - economic incentive for network security  

➡️ denominated in smaller units:
   - wei (smallest)
   - gwei (commonly used for gas pricing)
```

```markdown
### ▶ Other Blockchains (Besides Ethereum)
➡️ **Solana**
   - very high throughput
   - low transaction cost
   - different execution model  

➡️ **Polygon**
   - layer-2 / sidechain for Ethereum
   - improves scalability and lower fees
   - EVM-compatible  

➡️ **Avalanche**
   - fast finality
   - high scalability
   - supports smart contracts and DeFi  

➡️ each blockchain:
   - has its own consensus model
   - trade-offs between speed, cost, and decentralization
```
