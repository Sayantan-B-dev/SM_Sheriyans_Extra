```markdown
### ▶ Web 1.0
➡️ all content is created and hosted by website owners  
➡️ users are mostly consumers (read-only web)  
➡️ very less or no user interaction  
➡️ examples include early static websites  
➡️ mainly important from a historical evolution point of view
```

```markdown
### ▶ Web 2.0
➡️ centralized platforms with single or limited owners  
➡️ users can create content (posts, comments, media)  
➡️ enables communication, social interaction, and collaboration  

➡️ pros:
   - easy content creation
   - global communication
   - fast information sharing  

➡️ cons:
   - centralized control of data
   - data misuse and privacy issues
   - platform owners hold trust and power  

➡️ brings communication  
➡️ but trust is still placed in central authorities
```

```markdown
### ▶ Web 3.0
➡️ decentralized network architecture  
➡️ no single owner controls the system  
➡️ runs on multiple nodes (independent computers)  
➡️ peer-to-peer communication model  

➡️ data and logic are distributed across the network  
➡️ example concept: early peer-to-peer systems like Navstar  
➡️ trust is shifted from institutions to cryptography and protocol
```

```markdown
### ▶ Blockchain
➡️ a distributed and immutable ledger  
➡️ can be imagined like a shared digital book  
➡️ once data is written, it cannot be altered or deleted  
➡️ ledger is shared across many nodes instead of one server
```

```markdown
### ▶ How Blockchain Works
➡️ network consists of peer-to-peer nodes  
➡️ each node maintains a copy of the blockchain  

➡️ blocks are connected in a chain structure  
➡️ not everyone can freely see everything:
   - transparency exists
   - visibility depends on permissions and design  

➡️ each block contains:
   - list of transactions  
     → read/write operations  
     → each transaction includes:
         • transaction ID  
         • sender address  
         • receiver address  
         • digital signature (cryptographic proof of authenticity)

   - timestamp  
     → records when the block was created  

   - owner hash  
     → unique representation of the block  
     → usually generated using SHA-256  

   - previous hash  
     → hash of the previous block  
     → links blocks together  
     → prevents tampering and ensures integrity  

   - consensus number (nonce)  
     → number used during mining
```

```markdown
### ▶ Mining & Proof of Work
➡️ miner can be:
   - a node in the network
   - or an external participant  

➡️ miners solve a cryptographic puzzle  
➡️ puzzle is computationally expensive (math-based)  

➡️ once solved:
   - miner places the nonce into the block  
   - block is validated by the network  
   - block is added to the chain  

➡️ miner receives:
   - gas fee (reward for computation)

➡️ this process is called **Proof of Work**
```

```markdown
### ▶ Applications of Blockchain
➡️ healthcare:
   - connecting hospitals in a decentralized way  
   - secure sharing of patient records  

➡️ supply chain:
   - tracking food products from source to consumer  
   - ensuring transparency and authenticity  

➡️ eliminates single point of failure  
➡️ increases trust, security, and traceability
```
