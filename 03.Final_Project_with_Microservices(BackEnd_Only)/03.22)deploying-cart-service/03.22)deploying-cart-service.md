# 🌱 DOCKER + AWS ECS CART SERVICE — STEP-BY-STEP (EXPLAIN EACH)

## Make sure Docker and AWSCLI is installed properly

---

## `.dockerignore`

```

.env
node_modules

```

### What `.dockerignore` does
This file tells Docker **which files or folders must NOT be copied**
into the Docker image during build time.

### Why each entry exists

- `.env`  
  This file contains sensitive runtime values such as:
  - database connection strings
  - JWT secrets
  - service URLs  

  These values **must never be baked into a Docker image**.  
  In AWS ECS, environment variables are added **manually at task level**
  or via AWS Secrets Manager.

- `node_modules`  
  Node modules are OS-specific.  
  Your local system may differ from the ECS Linux environment.  
  Therefore dependencies must be installed **inside the container**
  using `npm install`.

---

## `dockerfile`

```

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3002

CMD ["npm", "start"]

```

### Explanation line by line

- `FROM node:18-alpine`  
  Uses Node.js version 18 on Alpine Linux.  
  Alpine is lightweight → smaller image → faster container startup.

- `WORKDIR /app`  
  Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container.  
  All following commands run relative to this directory.

- `COPY package*.json ./`  
  Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first.  
  This allows Docker to cache dependency installation layers.

- `RUN npm install`  
  Installs all Node.js dependencies **inside the container environment**.

- `COPY . .`  
  Copies the entire project source code into the container,
  while respecting `.dockerignore`.

- `EXPOSE 3002`  
  Documents that the application listens on **port 3002**.

- `CMD ["npm", "start"]`  
  Defines the default command used to start the container.

### IMPORTANT
Make sure your `package.json` contains:

```

"start": "node server.js"

```

Without this, the container will fail to start.

## making the page

- Turn ON **Docker Desktop**  
  Docker must be running before building images locally.

### Use this command to create image

```

docker buildx --platform linux/amd64 -t cohort-ms-cart-service:latest . --load

```

### What this command does

- `buildx` → advanced Docker builder
- `--platform linux/amd64` → required for AWS ECS compatibility
- `-t cohort-ms-cart-service:latest` → image name and tag
- `.` → current directory as build context
- `--load` → loads image into local Docker after build

---

## create a repo in ECR

### Steps in AWS Console

- Elastic Container Registry
- Create Repository
- Name it `cohort-ms-cart-service`
- Create

### From push commands section

- First login command  
  Authenticates Docker with AWS ECR.

- Build done  
  Image already exists locally.

- Tag command  
  Modify name if needed  
  Keep it same as build: `cohort-ms-cart-service`.

- Push command  
  Uploads the image to the ECR repository.

---

## Go back to console.

### ECS setup

- Create cluster
- After creation
- Create new task
- Name the task

### IAM roles

- `ecsTaskRole`  
  Used by the running application.

- `ecsTaskExecutionRole`  
  Used for:
  - pulling images
  - writing logs
  - accessing secrets  

Both can be selected.

### Container configuration

- Name container
- Go to ECR repo and copy image URI
- Paste image URI
- Select port you are using for the service (3002)
- Port name can be `express-app`
- Add **all `.env` variables manually**
- Create task definition

---

## Deploy the task/service

- Set service name
- Select the cluster we created
- Capacity provider strategy
- Health check: 5 sec
- Use same VPC if needed

### Load balancer configuration

- Create an ALB or use existing
- Listen to the created target group for the project with `/` path  
  (rules can also be added later)
- Create a new target group
- Use project port (3002)
- Set priority if required
- Modify path pattern if needed
- Create service

### Verification

- Go to EC2
- Check if the ALB has a listener
- Listener should forward traffic to the correct target group
- Copy the Domain name

### Usage

- Replace all `localhost:3002`
- Use the ALB domain in Axios and inter-service calls

---

## end work

### ALB routing refinement

- Go to your ALB
- Edit rule of newly deployed service
- Change path from:

```

/

```

to:

```

/api/cart/*

```

- Route this path to its own target group
- Target group must be the one created earlier for cart service

This ensures clean routing and avoids conflicts with other services.

---

## note

### If you get runtime error

- Fix the error locally
- Build the image again
- Push the updated image to ECR

### Force redeployment

- Go to ECS
- Clusters → `your cluster`
- Services → `your service`
- Health
- Click **Force new deployment**

This pulls the updated image and restarts the service.
