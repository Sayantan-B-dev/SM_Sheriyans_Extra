# 🌱 DOCKER + AWS ECS PRODUCT SERVICE — STEP-BY-STEP (EXPLAIN EACH)

## Make sure Docker and AWSCLI is installed properly

---

## `.dockerignore`

```

.env
node_modules

```

### What `.dockerignore` does
This file tells Docker which files/folders **must NOT be copied** into the image
during the build process.

### Why each entry exists

- `.env`  
  This file contains sensitive runtime values such as:
  - database URLs
  - JWT secrets
  - API keys  

  These values **must not be baked into Docker images**.  
  In ECS, environment variables are added manually at task level or via secrets.

- `node_modules`  
  Dependencies are OS-specific.  
  Your local machine may differ from ECS (Linux).  
  So dependencies are installed **inside the container** using `npm install`.

---

## `dockerfile`

```

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3001

CMD ["npm", "start"]

```

### Explanation line by line

- `FROM node:18-alpine`  
  Uses Node.js version 18 on Alpine Linux.  
  Alpine is lightweight → smaller image size → faster startup → lower cost.

- `WORKDIR /app`  
  Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container.  
  All following commands execute from this directory.

- `COPY package*.json ./`  
  Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first.  
  This enables Docker layer caching, so dependencies are not reinstalled on every build.

- `RUN npm install`  
  Installs all dependencies inside the container environment.

- `COPY . .`  
  Copies the entire project source code into the container,  
  excluding files mentioned in `.dockerignore`.

- `EXPOSE 3001`  
  Documents that the application listens on port **3001**.

- `CMD ["npm", "start"]`  
  Defines the default command to run when the container starts.

### IMPORTANT
Make sure your `package.json` contains:

```

"start": "node server.js"

```

## making the page

- Turn ON **Docker Desktop**  
  Docker must be running before building images.

### Use this command to create image

```

docker buildx --platform linux/amd64 -t cohort-ms-product-service . --load

```

### Explanation of the command

- `buildx` → advanced Docker builder
- `--platform linux/amd64` → required for AWS ECS compatibility
- `-t cohort-ms-product-service` → image name (tag omitted)
- `.` → current directory as build context
- `--load` → loads image into local Docker

### About `:latest`
`:latest` is **not mandatory**.  
If no tag is provided, Docker implicitly treats it as `latest`.

---

## create a repo in ECR

### Steps in AWS Console

- Elastic Container Registry
- Create Repository
- Name it `cohort-ms-product-service`
- Create

### From push commands section

- First login command  
  Authenticates Docker with AWS ECR.

- Build done  
  Image already exists locally.

- Tag command  
  Modify name if needed  
  Keep it same as build: `cohort-ms-product-service`.

- Push command  
  Uploads the image to ECR.

---

## Go back to console.

### ECS setup

- Create cluster
- After creation
- Create new task
- Name the task

### IAM roles

- `ecsTaskRole`  
  Used by the running application.

- `ecsTaskExecutionRole`  
  Used to pull image, write logs, read secrets.

Both can be selected.

### Container configuration

- Name container
- Go to ECR repo and copy image URI
- Paste image URI
- Select port you are using for the service (3001)
- Port name can be `express-app`
- Add all `.env` variables manually
- Create task definition

---

## Deploy the task/service

- Set service name
- Select the cluster we created
- Capacity provider strategy
- Health check: 5 sec
- Use same VPC if needed

### Load balancer configuration

- Create an ALB or use existing
- Listen to the created target group for the project with `/` path
- Create a new target group
- Use project port (3001)
- Set priority if required
- Modify path pattern if needed
- Create service

### Verification

- Go to EC2
- Check if the ALB has a listener
- Listener should forward traffic to the correct target group
- Copy the Domain name

### Usage

- Replace all `localhost:3001`
- Use the ALB domain in Axios and inter-service calls

---

## end work

### ALB routing refinement

- Go to your ALB
- Edit rule of newly deployed service
- Change path from `/` to:

```

/api/products/*

```

- Route this path to its own target group
- Target group must be the one created earlier for product service

This keeps routing clean and avoids service conflicts.

---

## note

### If you get runtime error

- Fix the error locally
- Build the image again
- Push the updated image to ECR

### Force redeployment

- Go to ECS
- Clusters → `your cluster`
- Services → `your service`
- Health
- **Force new deployment**

This pulls the latest image and restarts tasks.
