# 🌱 DOCKER + AWS ECS PAYMENT SERVICE — STEP-BY-STEP (EXPLAIN EACH)

## Make sure Docker and AWSCLI is installed properly

---

## `.dockerignore`

```

.env
node_modules

```

### What `.dockerignore` does
This file tells Docker which files or folders **must NOT be copied**
into the Docker image during the build process.

### Why each entry exists

- `.env`  
  This file contains sensitive runtime data such as:
  - database connection strings
  - payment gateway keys
  - JWT secrets  

  These values **must never be baked into a Docker image**.  
  In AWS ECS, environment variables are added **manually in the task definition**
  or through AWS Secrets Manager.

- `node_modules`  
  Node dependencies are OS-specific.  
  Your local machine may differ from ECS (Linux).  
  Therefore, dependencies must be installed **inside the container**
  using `npm install`.

---

## `dockerfile`

```

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3004

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

```

### Explanation line by line

- `FROM node:18-alpine`  
  Uses Node.js version 18 on Alpine Linux.  
  Alpine is lightweight → smaller image size → faster startup → lower memory usage.

- `WORKDIR /app`  
  Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container.  
  All subsequent commands run relative to this directory.

- `COPY package*.json ./`  
  Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first.  
  This enables Docker layer caching, so dependencies are not reinstalled
  unless these files change.

- `RUN npm install`  
  Installs all Node.js dependencies **inside the container environment**.

- `COPY . .`  
  Copies the entire project source code into the container,  
  while respecting the `.dockerignore` rules.

- `EXPOSE 3004`  
  Declares that the application listens on **port 3004**.

- `CMD ["node", "server.js"]`  
  Starts the application directly using Node.js.

### IMPORTANT
Even though the container uses `node server.js` directly,  
make sure your `package.json` also contains:

```

"start": "node server.js"

```

This keeps local development, testing, and ECS behavior consistent.

## making the page

- Turn ON **Docker Desktop**  
  Docker must be running before building images locally.

### Use this command to create image

```

docker buildx --platform linux/amd64 -t cohort-ms-payment-service . --load

```

### Explanation of the command

- `buildx` → advanced Docker builder
- `--platform linux/amd64` → required for AWS ECS compatibility
- `-t cohort-ms-payment-service` → image name (tag omitted)
- `.` → current directory as build context
- `--load` → loads image into local Docker

### About `:latest`
`:latest` is **not required**.  
If no tag is provided, Docker treats it as `latest` implicitly.

---

## create a repo in ECR

### Steps in AWS Console

- Elastic Container Registry
- Create Repository
- Name it `cohort-ms-payment-service`
- Create

### From push commands

- First login command  
  Authenticates Docker with AWS ECR.

- Build done  
  Image already exists locally.

- Tag command  
  Modify name if needed  
  Keep it same as build: `cohort-ms-payment-service`.

- Push command  
  Pushes the image to the ECR repository.

---

## Go back to console.

### ECS setup

- Create cluster
- After creation
- Create new task
- Name the task

### IAM roles

- `ecsTaskRole`  
  Used by the running application for AWS permissions.

- `ecsTaskExecutionRole`  
  Used to:
  - pull images from ECR
  - write logs to CloudWatch
  - access secrets  

Both can be selected.

### Container configuration

- Name container
- Go to ECR repo and copy image URI
- Paste image URI
- Select port you are using for the service (3004)
- Port name can be `express-app`
- Add **all `.env` variables manually**
- Create task definition

---

## Deploy the task/service

- Set service name
- Select the cluster we created
- Capacity provider strategy
- Health check: 5 sec
- Use same VPC if needed

### Load balancer configuration

- Create an ALB or use existing
- Listen to the created target group for the project with `/` path  
  (rules can be added later if required)
- Create a new target group
- Use project port (3004)
- Set priority if required
- Modify path pattern if needed
- Create service

### Verification

- Go to EC2
- Check if the ALB has a listener
- Listener should forward traffic to the correct target group
- Copy the Domain name

### Usage

- Replace all `localhost:3004`
- Use the ALB domain in Axios and inter-service communication

---

## end work

### ALB routing refinement

- Go to your ALB
- Edit rule of newly deployed service
- Change path from:

```

/

```

to:

```

/api/payments/*

```

- Route this path to its own target group
- Target group must be the one created earlier for payment service

This ensures proper routing and avoids conflicts with other services.

---

## note

### If you get runtime error

- Fix the error locally
- Build the image again
- Push the updated image to ECR

### Force redeployment

- Go to ECS
- Clusters → `your cluster`
- Services → `your service`
- Health
- Click **Force new deployment**

This pulls the updated image and restarts the service.
